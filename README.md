# WaterBodiesImageSegmentation

## TODO LIST
- upsample + dropout get to work
- historical averaging features etc in config

- try to create inference notebook because it will fit best there
- script for training models with different configs
- think about better approach for model names in inference instead of e and i iterators
- merge this branch into main 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- add more information in readme about this project
- wgan on different branch so we have to merge it after cleanup
- have wgan and simple gan in config
- loss.py?  <- when WGAN
- find which gan is the best in zoo
- download it and try to use
- using colab to train bigger networks
- folder structure for project instead of all in src 

## DONE LIST  ( TO TRACK PROGRESS )
- config for model creation
- two different block with conv2dtranspose and upsample
- cleanup in inference code    
- generator_blocks.py        
- discriminator_blocks.py    
- generator.py               
- discriminator.py           

## SOME NOTES
I think that WGAN and DCGAN have differences in last layer and how loss calculation happens

## PAPERS USED 
TBD
